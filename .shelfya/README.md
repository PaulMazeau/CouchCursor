# Shelfya Integration Guide

Welcome to the Shelfya plugin for Figma! This guide will help you get started quickly and make the most of the integration.

## Overview

The Shelfya plugin connects Figma to your CouchCursor-powered data backend, enabling design-to-data workflows directly within your Figma projects. Use Shelfya to import data, sync UI components, and streamline your design process.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install the Shelfya Plugin

- Open Figma and go to **Community**.
- Search for **Shelfya**.
- Click **Install**.

### 2. Connect to CouchCursor

After installing the plugin:

1. Open your project in Figma.
2. Run the **Shelfya** plugin via the right-click menu or from the Plugins section.
3. Follow the authentication prompts to connect to your CouchCursor-backed database.

### 3. Using Shelfya

- **Import Data:** Bring real data into your designs. Select a component, choose a dataset, and see it fill with backend content.
- **Sync UI States:** Push design changes back to CouchCursor or update designs when data changes.
- **Collaborate:** Share data-driven Figma files with your team for review and iteration.

## Example Workflow
